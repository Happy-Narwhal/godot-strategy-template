TBS Template is intended to be a starting point for a variety of turn-based strategy games.

**Project setup:**
- Take a look at plug.gd. Add or remove plugins as you see fit. Then install plugins (additional documentation at https://github.com/imjp94/gd-plug/tree/master).
For example:
`"C:/Program Files/Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe" --headless -s plug.gd install`
- Enable plugins in project settings (maybe)

**Contributing**
Contributions & collaboration are welcome! Message if you're interested.

**Style Guide**

The code here is intended to be as versatile as possible, showcasing best practices and providing a solid and easy to follow starting point for strategy game development.
- Method and variable names should be descriptive.
- Functions should be relatively short - linting setup should include checking cyclomatic complexity of functions.
- Use static typing for variables. While optional in GDScript, using static typing results in cleaner and more maintainable code.
- Code comments are encouraged and should maintain consistent formatting with the repository.
